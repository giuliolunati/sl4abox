Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A) brings scripting languages to Android by
allowing you to edit and execute scripts and interactive interpreters directly
on the Android device. These scripts have access to many of the APIs available
to full-fledged Android applications, but with a greatly simplified interface
that makes it easy to get things done.

Scripts can be run interactively in a terminal and in the background.  Python,
Perl, JRuby, Lua, BeanShell, JavaScript, Tcl, and shell are currently supported,
and we're planning to add more. See the [SL4A Video
Help](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL07A81E6CE96F158B) playlist on
YouTube for various demonstrations of SL4A's features.

SL4A is designed for developers and is _alpha_ quality software.
