Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A) brings scripting languages to Android by
allowing you to edit and execute scripts and interactive interpreters directly
on the Android device. These scripts have access to many of the APIs available
to full-fledged Android applications, but with a greatly simplified interface
that makes it easy to get things done.
Scripts can be run interactively in a terminal, in the background, or via
[http://www.androidlocale.com/ Locale]. Python, Perl, JRuby, Lua, !BeanShell,
!JavaScript, Tcl, and shell are currently supported, and we're planning to add
more. See the [http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL07A81E6CE96F158B SL4A
Video Help] playlist on !YouTube for various demonstrations of SL4A's features.
SL4A is designed for developers and is _alpha_ quality software. Please report
bugs and feature requests on the
[http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/wiki/Issues?tm=3 issues list]. You
can download the current APK by scanning or clicking the following barcode:

To install SL4A, you will need to enable the "Unknown sources" option in your
device's "Application" settings.

== What's Powered by SL4A? ==
Want to see SL4A in action? Check out some of these cool SL4A powered projects:

=== Rockets ===
SL4A was used by the Nexus One payload for sensor logging. See the
[http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/07/nexus_onearduino_smallsat_satellite.html
article in Make] for more information about the project.

=== Cellbots ===
We are a collection of hobbyists who want to free your cell phone from your
pocket and let it connect and move with the real world. How? As a robot of
course!
Cellbots aren't just about using your phone to control a robot (which is cool
too), but we aim on making your phone be the robot. It already has touch,
hearing, speech, vibration, and many more senses, but needs legs (or wheels) to
finally be the free roaming robot it was born to be.
See the [http://www.cellbots.com/ Cellbots blog] or
[http://www.youtube.com/user/cellbots YouTube channel] for more.

=== Oplop ===
Using a single master password and various account names, one can create an
infinite number of unique account passwords. These unique account passwords are
commonly called password hashes, domain-specific passwords, or per-site
passwords.
See the [http://code.google.com/p/oplop/ Oplop] project page for more
information.

=== Broadcast ===
Broadcast is an embedded web application for remote Android device management.
Broadcast has four goals:
* Remote monitoring: Make Android state and device data available over a
network.
* Remote control: Allow remote control of an Android device over a network.
* Proof-of-concept: Demonstrate that complex ruby applications can run in an
Android environment, even with constrained resources.
* Framework: Set the groundwork for a number of advanced applications.
See [http://github.com/mleone/broadcast/ the project homepage], this
[http://www.slideshare.net/panopticdev/broadcast-presentation presentation],
and this [http://i52.tinypic.com/w9zfh4.jpg screenshot] for more information.

=== SMS Merger ===
SMS Merger is an excellent example of what can be done with Python and the
!WebView API. SMS Merger is designed to send a series of personalized SMS. For
example, to let Antony, Bob and Claire know which seat number they have been
allocated for their exams, SMS Merger can turn a CSV file into the following SMS
messages:
Dear Antony, your seat is A1
Dear Bob, your seat is M4
Dear Claire, your seat is M2
